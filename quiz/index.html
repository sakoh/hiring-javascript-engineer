    <h1>Quiz</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Name three people that you follow, admire or recognize from the JS field <b>Jeremy Ashkenas Brendan Eich Yehuda Katz</b></li>
        <li>What's the name of the standard backing JS implementations? <b>ECMA International</b></li>
        <li>Name three major (old, current or new) JS implementations. <b>ES5 ES6 ES7</b></li>
        <li>Name four websites that you use constanly while web developing. <b>Stack Overflow W3Schools developer.mozilla.org http://sass-lang.com/</b></li>
        <li>What is minification and why we should use it? Do you use it? How? <b>Minification removes all spaces and lines so that files are smaller. I use it a lot, usually doing through with a task running tool like Grunt</b></li>
        <li>What is the DOM? And the BOM? What's the difference? Give us a one-line example of using each one. <b>The DOM(Document Object Model) is a representation of the markup in the usually HTML, and sometimes XML or XHTML, file. BOM(Browser Object Model) deals more with the other objects in the browser that are not related to the markup such as the url, the location, and history.</b></li>
        <li>Why is HTML5shiv important on some browsers? <b>Because some browsers, especially the older versions of Internet Explorer don't support HTML5.</b></li>
        <li>How many ways to communicate between two different domain pages do you know? (client-side, of course) <b>RESTFUL API and Web sockets</b></li>
        <li>Is <em>document.write</em> good or bad? When its good? When its bad? <b>It is good for a simple html files, but not big html files where you would replace the entire markup of the page if you run the command.</b></li>
        <li>What do you understand for self-invoking function? Do you use them? Why? <b>A self-invoking function runs automatically when the browser page loads. I use it sometimes, primarily to wrap all of my JavaScript code in the function so that it is protected from the global scope.</b></li>
        <li>Do you use JSLint or JSHint? What about strict mode? Why? <b>I use jslint and I use strict mode so that it throws an error when my code doesn't follow good JavaScript coding standards.</b></li>
        <li>What do you know about memory leaks?</li>
        <li>Have you heard of the "Repainting" problem on the browser? Tell us about it.</li>
        <li>Write the best implementation of "blackBox" you can think of:
<pre>
    blackBox('GumGum') === 'GumGum'
    blackBox('GumGum','Test') === 'GumGum-Test:GumGum-Test'
    blackBox('GumGum','Test','Join Us') === "GumGum-Test-Join Us!:GumGum-Test-Join Us!:GumGum-Test-Join Us!"
</pre>
        </li>
        <li>What are you daily basis tools when coding and releasing your code? <b>Webstorm, PHPStorm, Sublime Text, Atom Editor, SourceTree</b></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Extras</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>How would you deploy directly from your git repo? <b>git push origin</b></li>
        <li>What does 664 means to you and your files?</li>
    </ol>
