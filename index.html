<h1>GumGum - JavaScript Engineering Skill Test</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In this Skill Test we will try to assest your knowledge and experience when it comes to develop
using JavaScript language.
We will also cover some other web-based development tools and concepts.</p>

<p><strong>What&#39;s important for us?</strong></p>

<ul><li>You are honest. Its OK to say <em>I don&#39;t know</em>.</li><li>GumGum is highly dynamic, we move fast but we need to be careful.</li><li>We prefer quality over speed, and speed over quantity.</li><li>You are a team player, please be considerate while coding.</li><li>Pay attention to the details.</li><li>Be communicative.</li><li>Be communicative. Really.</li></ul>

<p><strong>So, what&#39;s covered in this exercises?</strong></p>

<ul><li>JavaScript. Core, raw, pure javascript. <em>We love jQuery too, but this position is not about it</em>.</li><li>JavaScript patterns, OOJS or JSOO, closures, callbacks, scopes, prototypes and all that jazz.</li><li>The Browser(s): DOM, BOM, Developer tools, Debugging, etc.</li><li>Cross-Browser Compatibility: Hacks, Polyfills, performance comparisons, etc.</li><li>Client-side communication.</li><li>HTML(5) and CSS(3). Responsive design.</li><li>Some TDD, some Git, some 3rd party software, etc.</li></ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ul><li>Read these instructions and each of the test carefully before you start to code.</li><li>You DON&#39;T need to complete ALL the tests to send them back to use, you can choose and go for quality over quantity. But the more the merrier.</li><li>We recommend you to get (however you like) this folder, so you can send it back to us and we will easily check your changes ;)</li><li>Each folder has a different test, some will require extra files, some won&#39;t. You&#39;re free to modify these files in order to complete the test, just be sure that your answers will work out-of-the-box or create a README file about how to set it up (or automate it).</li><li>Each test is completely unstyled, we don&#39;t require you to beautify it but we do like pretty things too.</li><li>There&#39;s no numeration of the test so difficulty its not progressive, so be ready.</li><li>We will use internet-enabled computers while reviewing your work, so don&#39;t hesitate to use online resources (as long as they are available for us).</li><li>We would love to see minified code, but please also send us the original un-minified code.</li><li>Please let us know an ETA for your test.</li><li>Assume the general rules for all the tasks:<ul><li>No jQuery or 3rd party JS libs</li><li>No PHP/Server-side processing.</li></ul></li><li>For bonus points on all tasks:<ul><li>Readable and logically documented code, no need to document each line, but one or two lines in the interesting parts is ok.</li><li>JSHint/Lint pass.</li></ul></li></ul>
